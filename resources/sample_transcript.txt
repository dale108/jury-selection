[13.7s - 26.9s] A
   be fair and impartial and listen to the evidence with an open mind. With that being said, we understand that you've come here with your life experiences and we're not asking you to forget about those, but we're asking you to talk to us open and honestly.

[27.1s - 31.5s] A
   There's no right or wrong answer to these questions, we just want open and honest answers from you.

[32.1s - 35.2s] A
   For that being said also, if I ask you anything that you don't want to talk about with everyone else, if you're uncomfortable,

[35.3s - 37.0s] A
   please just let us know, we can go to the sidebar and talk about it privately.

[38.1s - 40.1s] A
   The first thing that I want to start with is that the state has a burden,

[40.1s - 41.5s] A
   bring her to the table, it never leaves,

[41.5s - 43.2s] A
   and that's a burden to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt.

[44.2s - 45.4s] A
   Does anyone have a problem with that burden?

[45.8s - 48.0s] A
   Or that it does not shift to the defense at any point? Does anyone have a problem with that?

[48.5s - 50.0s] A
   All right, so head shaking no, we are off to a great start.

[50.9s - 57.7s] A
   You heard the allegations are that the defendant assaulted an individual at a bar, and then when the officers arrived,

[57.8s - 58.8s] A
   he tried,

[58.9s - 59.9s] A
   he resisted arrest.

[60.8s - 62.9s] A
   Hearing just those three validations, nothing else,

[63.2s - 64.3s] A
   is there anyone here that says,

[64.3s - 64.8s] A
   Deanna,

[65.0s - 66.2s] A
   this is not the case for me.

[66.3s - 68.6s] A
   Based on just what I'm hearing, I cannot be fair and impartial.

[69.9s - 71.1s] A
   Okay, so no hands again.

[72.1s - 79.3s] A
   So, in this case the state is largely going to prove the case by having witnesses come over here to the witness stand.

[79.6s - 83.4s] A
   They're going to take an oath to tell you the truth and tell you what they remember from that day, what they saw,

[83.5s - 84.5s] A
   what they heard, what they felt.

[85.7s - 87.5s] A
   The judge will instruct you that testimony is evidence.

[88.4s - 92.0s] A
   Anyone that said anyone here that says I don't need something more, I can't just sit with testimony.

[93.5s - 97.8s] A
   Okay, I'm seeing heads shaking no. Now is when I'm going to start calling on you guys for a little bit of input.

[98.3s - 101.5s] A
   So while a witness testifies, you're going to have to assess their credibility.

[103.2s - 104.9s] A
   Number nine, how would you assess someone's credibility?

[105.9s - 106.8s] B
   Um, body language.

[107.7s - 108.3s] C
   Tone of voice.

[108.7s - 111.4s] A
   Okay. Good. And number seven, how about you?

[112.2s - 114.1s] A
   Um, I think whether or not they make eye contact.

[118.0s - 119.1s] A
   And when you say make eye contact,

[119.2s - 120.0s] A
   do you mean with myself,

[120.0s - 120.7s] A
   with the defense attorney,

[120.8s - 122.7s] A
   with the jurors? I think that you meant me. Okay.

[123.2s - 125.7s] A
   And I see number six, you're shaking your head yes, do you agree with that?

[125.7s - 131.3s] D
   I agree. I agree. I also think that if there's a bunch of ums and pauses or any shifting of movement,

[131.5s - 133.9s] D
   I think that might be problematic as well at times, as straight up.

[133.9s - 134.8s] A
   Okay, problematic how?

[134.8s - 136.5s] A
   Why would you assess that as not being credible?

[136.5s - 140.3s] D
   I don't know if you can trust somebody who can't be still when they're telling the facts that they know.

[140.7s - 145.7s] A
   Okay, so you think that if someone is a little fidgety, it may go to their credibility?

[148.8s - 153.0s] D
   They shouldn't be nervous, I mean, surely they're nervous about this process, but they shouldn't be nervous about the things that they're saying.

[153.3s - 156.6s] A
   Okay, and number twenty three, sir, uh how about you, how would you assess credibility?

[157.0s - 166.0s] E
   Probably would agree with much of what was said already and maybe just add to that if they contradict themselves or contradict somebody else, I guess we have to figure that out. But uh

[166.0s - 169.9s] A
   okay. So if there is um a witness who contradicts another witness?

[182.6s - 202.1s] A
   I think in how confident they present uh the information and um I d I don't necessarily agree that if someone is fidgety that, you know, that would make them not credible. Um it's uh probably a nerve wracking experience testifying. Um so I would just have to listen to the consistency and the confidence.

[202.7s - 206.3s] A
   Okay, is there anyone that, I see number twenty five you're shaking your head in agreement it looks like, wha

[206.6s - 207.8s] A
   uh how would you assess somebody's credibility?

[208.1s - 208.3s] A
   Do you agree?

[208.5s - 211.1s] F
   Yeah, I agree that the person that came to my room was confidence as well. I

[211.1s - 211.2s] A
   Okay.

[211.2s - 214.2s] F
   agree like the visioning doesn't necessarily mean they're not confident.

[214.8s - 219.0s] A
   Now, is there anyone here uh who thinks something differently on how to assess someone's credibility?

[220.0s - 222.2s] A
   Number nineteen, ma'am, I see you're thinking about that.

[222.5s - 225.2s] A
   Um how would you assess someone's credibility? What would you look for?

[225.9s - 230.8s] F
   I think consistency in their verbal and physical assertion is the first thing to check there. Um their body language.

[232.0s - 233.4s] A
   Okay. And my body language, what do you mean?

[260.0s - 265.0s] A
   I do. I believe that police officers and prosecutors rarely get it wrong. So I would find them more credible.

[265.3s - 268.0s] A
   Okay, and uh when you say rarely get it wrong, what do you mean by that?

[268.2s - 271.8s] A
   I mean that whenever they bring something and they're filling out their reports, being a police officer,

[271.9s - 275.8s] A
   they pretty much are on point with everything that was told to them. They present it in a case fully.

[276.1s - 277.5s] A
   So I believe their testimony.

[278.0s - 285.4s] A
   Okay, and you would believe their testimony of an officer uh more than just a a normal civilian person. Is that what you're saying? Correct. Okay, and I appreciate your honesty on this topic. Uh

[286.9s - 290.8s] A
   that you would believe in Officer Moore, would you not be able to be fair and impartial in this case?

[291.3s - 293.7s] A
   I believe I can listen to the facts and be fair and impartial.

[293.9s - 293.9s] A
   Okay.

[293.9s - 294.1s] F
   Yes.

[294.1s - 303.8s] A
   And do you believe that you'd be able to give, um, an officer, you'd listen and assess the officer's credibility the same way you would assess the civilians? Or you think automatically just because they they wear a uniform,

[303.9s - 305.0s] A
   you're gonna believe them more?

[305.5s - 306.7s] F
   I'm unsure about that. I think

[306.7s - 306.7s] A
   Okay.

[306.7s - 308.4s] F
   it depends on more than what I'm listening.

[309.3s - 321.3s] A
   So when I knew that I was going through the same situation, I would think I would find it difficult to believe the other person as opposed to the officer. Christ, you're saying you would uh consider, you know, if you have a friend or someone that went through a similar situation, um watch you walk me through that. What do you mean by that?

[321.4s - 326.2s] A
   So, I mean, if I had a friend or a family member, a close family member going through the same situation that we're about to hear,

[326.4s - 334.9s] A
   I think I would be more on the side of the officer being credible as opposed to the defendant. Okay, and so you're um well I mean we know very limited about the

[335.0s - 340.5s] A
   this case so far, you just know the allegation. Is there something about the allegations that right off the bat um you say, I can't be fair and impartial?

[341.2s - 349.8s] A
   Um I just heard the basic uh that it was a peasant of a violent nature, so for me I don't like violence um so that right there to me would put me at a different light as far as being part of the jury.

[349.9s - 351.8s] A
   Okay, and I appreciate your honesty about for that.
